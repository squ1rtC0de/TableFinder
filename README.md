# Table Finder (my graduation project at the university)
TableFinder is a program for identifying and marking tables in Excel. If you have manually created tables in Excel and you need to identify it, you can use this program. 
START: Open the file "Table Finder.exe" and select the file or catalog with the tables. The result of processing will be in the folder "tables", which will contain JSON files with the coordinates of the tables and their functional areas.
